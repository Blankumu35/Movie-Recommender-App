The version thats deployed in vercel isn't connected to the backend, therefore signing in or liking items isn't possible.

I want to deploy this app using AWS-EC2 but I need to dockerise the app. I also need to complete the final part of this project, which is to show a list of recommended movies/tv shows based on what the user liked. I need to collect data of all movies/tv shows
from TMDB and this will take some time, since I can't just download a file with all the movies/tv shows.

Like movies, tv shows or people and the app will recommend you moives and tv shows by using content-based filtering
